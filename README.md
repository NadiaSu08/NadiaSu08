### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome!
ðŸ‘‹ Greetings! I am Nadia! I have pursued my BSc. from Jahangirnagar University in Information Technology. With just completing my final exams, I'm fueled by ambition and enthusiasm, both in professional and personal interactions.

ðŸš€ My coursework has equipped me with practical knowledge and hands-on experience in a variety of programming languages including C, C++, Python, Java, and SQL. I'm also adept at navigating operating systems such as Windows and Linux.

ðŸ’¡ Additionally, I've honed my skills in wireframing, prototyping, user research, and usability testing through coursework and project work. I thrive on collaborating with stakeholders, developers, and fellow designers to ensure the delivery of cohesive and user-friendly products.
